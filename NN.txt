neural network
neuron- thing that holds a no
/ function that contains outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between zero
network - that connetcs each neuron
* the number that neuron holds is called Activation 
* last layer - o/p
* hidden layer = middle layers 
* activation of 1 layer determines activation another layer
* higher the activation higher the chance of becoming the o/p
